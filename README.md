### How to start project locally

Project is split into two folders: `frontend` and `backend`.

To start project locally, first navigate to `/backend` folder.

Then install all backend dependecies with command:

> yarn

Backend uses `nodemon` for hot server reload every time server file is saved.

Start server with command:

> yarn dev

It should print following output:

> ✅ WebSocket Server listening on ws://localhost:4000

> Server started on http://localhost:4000

Great we now have our backend up and running. Let' move to frontend.

Open new terminal and navigate to `/frontend` folder.

Again, to install all dependecies run:

> yarn

Same as with backend, start frontend client with:

> yarn dev

Now your frotend is up and running on port 5173.

Open new browser tab with same url: http://localhost:5173.
